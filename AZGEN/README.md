##Summary
We have processed carrier, exome, pediatric and cardio/neuro data through our internal bcbio pipeline which aligned data using bwa aligner against hg19 genome with vardict as variant caller and seq2C as copy number caller. We have generated the bedfile using hg19 ensemble data that has been annotated and extended using bedtools. The variants calls were compared against invitae details provided in the readme file, and further analysed to diagnose the disease and compare the symptoms with that of patient's. The mutations related to CPS1, SCN5A, SGCB/DYSF, SP110/STAT1 were related to vomiting after feeding at infancy, abdominal/visceral pain, pelvic/knee pain and fungal infections respectively. Most of the treatments related to the above diseases are at research or clinical phase which made it difficult for us to conclude about the treatment options. We hope these genetic diagnosis will help with improving the methods to accelerate research and treatment options.
